// EASY: Create two variables and assign a person’s name to each. Console log a statement that says which name is shorter
// or longer, and by how many characters. Example output: “The name Thomas is longer than John by 2 characters”

let person1 = "Darlene"
let person2 = "Jose"

console.log(`The name ${person1} is longer than ${person2} by ${person1.length - person2.length} characters.`)
